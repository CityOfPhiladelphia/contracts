## Overview

This data was submitted to meet the quarterly reporting requirements outlined in  [Section 17-1403](http://phillycode.org/17-1403/) of the Philadelphia Code. 

It includes the following information for contracts under which services were rendered during the reporting quarter: the parties to the contract; the subject matter of the contract; the term of the contract; the length of the term remaining; the total dollar amount of the contract and the total payments made to date. The data also includes the following information for financial assistance provided during the reporting period: the city agency providing the assistance; the type of assistance; the recipient of the assistance and the amount of the assistance. The amount of the assistance detailed in the data reflects the total amount of the deal (ex: bond, loan) for which financial assistance was rendered. 

## Field Names and Descriptions

* *original_contract_id* – the original contract number assigned at the time of contract initiation.  All Miscellaneous Purchase Orders always have a contract number beginning with MPXX.  Additionally, the first two numbers of the contract number identify the fiscal year in which the contract was originally initiated.  For example, a contract number of 1312345 was initiated in Fiscal Year 2013.
* *current_item_id* – the current contract number, which is comprised of the original contract number plus an additional identifier indicating the number of total renewals or amendments on the contract.  For example, a contract number of 1312345-01 denotes that there is one (1) renewal or amendment on the contract. 
* *department_name*  - the name of the contracting department.
* *vendor* – the name of the vendor currently holding the contract.
* *contract_structure_type* – the general category of contracted services. 
* *short desc* – a brief description of the contracted services. 
* *start_dt* – the start date of the current term of the contract.  The contracts displayed on this site have a current term that was “active” during the stated time period (ex: Quarter 3 of Fiscal Year 2013), which means the start date fell during this time period and the contract has been executed (i.e. signed by all parties). 
* *end_dt* – the end date of the current term of the contract.
* *days_remaining*  - the number of days remaining on the current term of the contract.  If the days remaining is zero (0), this means the end date expired during the time period reported on this site
* *amt* - the amount of the current contract item.  This does not represent the total contract amount (original contract amount + amounts of all renewals and amendments).  For example, this amount should be looked at in conjunction with the current item id.  If the current item id indicates that the term displayed is either the renewal or amended term, than the amount shown is the amount for that renewal or amendment.  As such, a contract amount of $0 may indicate that the contract was renewed for time only and no additional money was added for the renewal term. 
* *tot_payments* -  the total amount of all payments initiated to date for the reportable contract term.  The payments initiated during the reported quarter may be for services rendered during a previous quarter.
* *orig_vendor* – the original vendor on the contract at the time of initiation.  In some instances, the original vendor may be different than the current vendor.   This typically occurs when a vendor changes its name or if the City assigns the contract to a different vendor during the life of the contract (ex:  when one company takes over another company).


## Notes

If the current term amended a previous contract during its term (e.g. to modify the scope of services), the entry reflects the terms of the current contract, as so amended.

Contracts that show a $0 dollar contract amount may reflect instances in which payments are not rendered through any appropriations or in which the original contract was amended to extend the contract term without additional money added.

Contracts that show payments greater than the contract amount may reflect the following: instances in which payments for services rendered under a prior contract term are being made during the reporting period; or, instances in which payments are not rendered through the City of Philadelphia’s Financial Accounting Management Information System.

Negative contract amounts reflect instances in which the amendment reduced the amount of the prior contract term.

'General Consultant Services under $30,000' are contracts for $30,000 or less and may include, but are not limited to, services in the following categories: architect and engineer services, audio visual and display services, behavioral health-mental retardation services, computer and information services, health-related services, homelessness-related services, general consultant services, legal services, and personnel-related services.

Information on sole source contracts, managed by the Procurement Department, is extracted from several information systems. Due to limitations with these specific systems, it is difficult to obtain the same information for these contracts as for other non- competitively bid contracts. Below you will find an explanation of the difference in the information presented.

* Certain sole source contracts are displayed as four-year contracts, due to limitations in the reporting systems; however, all sole source contracts are subject to the same renewal provisions as other contracts (one base year term with three options to renew for additional year-long terms). No sole source contract term (unless noted) is for greater than twelve months.

* The days remaining column is calculated using the stated end date. This may include presumptive renewal amendments; however, renewals are certified by the Procurement Commissioner on an annual basis and should not always be assumed to occur.

* The amount listed for sole source contracts is the total amount authorized for the contract terms to date. For example, if a sole source contract has a term of 7/1/07 to 6/30/11, the contract amount listed is for contract terms from 7/1/07 to 6/30/11.

* The payments listed are all payments from the beginning of the contract term through the end of the reportable quarter. This includes contract terms prior to the current active amendment term.
