## Notes

Unlike Professional Services contracts, Procurement contracts are typically not negotiated but are subject to the lowest, responsive, responsible bidder requirements found in <a href="http://www.amlegal.com/nxt/gateway.dll/Pennsylvania/philadelphia_pa/philadelphiahomerulecharter/articleviiiprovisionsofgeneralapplicatio/chapter2contractsprocurementpropertyandr?f=templates$fn=default.htm$3.0$vid=amlegal:philadelphia_pa$anc=JD_Art.VIIICh.">Section 8-200</a> of the Home Rule Charter. As such, they must be awarded to the bidder offering the lowest price, whose bid meets the bid specifications (responsive) and who is also capable of the performance required under the contract (responsible). These contracts are also known as “competitively bid contracts”. Some specific points about Procurement contracts:

* The Procurement Department, not City operating departments, is the central agency responsible for managing the bid and contract execution process for the purchase of supplies, equipment, non-professional services, public works services, and concession agreements.
* Procurement contracts for supplies, equipment, and non-professional services (referred to as “SS&E” in the graphs and charts below) fall into two main categories: departmental and city-wide (definitions of both terms can be found in the FAQ section). These contracts are typically awarded for a term of one year with up to three one-year renewals.
* The Procurement Department manages the bid and contract execution process for public works contracts (referred to as “PW” in the graphs and charts below). Generally, only five departments manage the public works projects once the contracts are signed. Those departments are Streets, Water, Public Property, Licenses and Inspections and the Airport. These contracts generally have multi-year terms and are not renewed.
* Procurement contracts that are valued at less than $32,000 within a fiscal year are referred to as “Small Order Purchases” or “SOPs” and are issued by individual departments.
