    <p>Open data is increasingly the metric by which a cityâ€™s transparency is measured. Since Mayor Nutter established an <a href="{{ "/executive-order/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">open data policy in 2012</a>, over 100 datasets have been released, including Part I crime incidents, contracts for professional services, licenses and violations, property assessments, and bike thefts. But that's only the beginning.</p>
