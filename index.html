<h1>OPEN CONTRACT DATA</h1>
<h3 class="mission">The data provided on the Open Contract Data site is provided in a summary format but you can also download the entire data set supporting the charts and tables on the site.</h3>
<div class="row intro">
  <div class="col-md-12">
    <p>City contracts are broken down into two main categories â€“ contracts for professional services or for commodities.  Below you will find a link to data on both types of contracts.  The City utilizes different systems depending on the type of contract and, as such, the data is currently not available in one data file.  However, it is our goal, in future versions of the site, to provide information on all City contracts, regardless of the contract type, in one data set.</p>
