    <h2>Open Contract Data</h2>
    <p>
    City contracts are broken down into two main categories â€“ contracts for professional services and for commodities. 
    The City utilizes different systems depending on the type of contract and, as such, the data is currently not available in one data file.
    A future version of the site will provide combined information on all City contracts, regardless of the contract type, in one data set.
